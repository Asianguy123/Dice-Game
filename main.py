#Dice game

#The points rolled on each playerâ€™s dice are added to their score.
#If the total is an even number, an additional 10 points are added to their score.
#If the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score.
#If they roll a double, they get to roll one extra die and get the number of points rolled added to their score.
#The score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point.
#The person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.
#If  both  players  have  the  same  score  at  the  end  of  the  5  rounds,  they  each  roll  1  die  and  whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins).
